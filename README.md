# MUI + UXPin Merge with Theme creator

## Steps

1. [Install](#installation)
2. Open [Theme-Creator](#preview-components-in-theme-creator)
3. [Modify MUI Theme](#modifying-mui-theme)
4. [Run UXPin in local development](#run-uxpin-in-local-development)
5. [Push to your specific UXPin library](#push-uxpin)


## Installation

The library was initially created with  [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) by the UXPin team. So, it is recommended to use `Yarn`.  

But, You could also install it with `NPM` as well without any major effect.

**Yarn Installation**
```bash
yarn
```
**NPM Installation**
```bash
npm install --force
```

## Preview components in Theme-Creator
**Yarn**
```bash
yarn theme-creator
```
**NPM**
```bash
npm run theme-creator
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in the browser.

## Modifying MUI Theme

To modify theme:
1. Do the [Preview components in local](#preview-components-in-local)
2. Then, edit file `src/components/UXPinWrapper/boilerplate-theme.ts`, and put the required changes into the `boilerplateTheme` variable.
3. The `Preview components in local` will automatically reloaded when the `src/components/UXPinWrapper/boilerplate-theme.ts` is saved with correct value.

**Note:** 

`src/components/UXPinWrapper/boilerplate-theme.ts` uses React CSS, a bit different to the HTML CSS.
- You could utilize the Visual Studio Code's intellisense to help you assign the React CSS.
- Or, you could use tool https://staxmanade.com/CssToReact/ that is able to convert HTML CSS into React CSS
